TEA homemade implementations based on tea.c source code:

- TEA_{O1,O2,Od,Ox}.exe : original source code, different compiler options.
- TEA_Od_Cache.exe : the delta constant initialization is "hidden", making static tools useless.
- TEA_Delta_Rounds_Diff.exe : custom TEA with special delta constant and round number values.
